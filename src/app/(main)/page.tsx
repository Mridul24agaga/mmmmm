          Welcome to MemoriesLived.com
          This idea came to me after my father-in-law, Larry Knoll, was cremated, leaving us no physical place to remember him. Combined with my family being buried too far away to visit, I wanted to create a thoughtful space where anyone could grieve, laugh, love, and celebrate those they have lostâ€”anytime, anywhere.
          I encourage you to create a Memorial Page, add Memories pictures and stories, and follow others. You can also take advantage of topic-based public Forums, write directly to another user with Messages, exchange personally with a self-designed Virtual Companion, or convert to Diary mode to record private thoughts and feelings.
          I hope this site brings you comfort in your time of loss.
